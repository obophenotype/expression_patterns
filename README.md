Expression data can take many forms: Annotations with ontology terms; expression pattern images in 2D or 3D, registered to a reference standard or unregistered; Image of single labelled cells or clones of cells that make up some part of an expression pattern; RNA seq data for identified tissues, groups of cells or single cells.

The aim of this site is to document semantic patterns that can be used to relate annotations to images, samples or drawn from papers so that the data from all of them can be integrated into a queryable whole.  

Example use cases:

* Querying for genes expressed in some specified structure
* Finding images of the expression pattern of some specified gene
* Finding images of  expression patterns
* Finding images of expression pattern fragments.
